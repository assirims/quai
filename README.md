QuAI is QNAP’s AI Developer Package, for data scientists and Engineers, to quickly build, train and optimize their AI Models, on top of QNAP NAS. 

QuAI enables data scientists and developers to quickly and easily build, train, Optimize and deploy machine learning models with high-performance machine learning algorithms, broad range of AI  framework support on top of QNAP's robust NAS

Container Based Architecture:
QuAI leverages QNAP's light weight virtualization solution - Container Station.  QuAI is set of AI frameworks which user can launch on top of container station in no time and with the help of GPU pass-through technology start building and training his AI models with accelerated computing performance by harnessing the power of the graphics processing unit (GPU).

Supports all leading DL frameworks:
QuAI Supports all the leading deep learning frameworks such as MXNet, TensorFlow, Caffe, Caffe2, Microsoft CNTK, CUDA. All these frameworks are  available as container images in QNAP's container station. 

This repository is to maintain all the QuAI sample applications and respective source codes.
