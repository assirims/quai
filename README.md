# QuAI

QuAI enables data scientists and developers to quickly and easily build, train, optimize and deploy machine learning models with high-performance machine learning algorithms, broad range of AI framework support on top of QNAP's robust NAS.

## Container Based Architecture:

QuAI leverages QNAP's lightweight virtualization solution - Container Station. QuAI is set of utilities which user can launch on top of container station in no time and with the enabling of the GPU support, start building and training the AI models with accelerated computing performance by harnessing the power of the graphics processing unit (GPU).

## Supports leading Deep Learning frameworks:

QuAI supports all the leading deep learning frameworks such as Caffe, Caffe2, CUDA, Microsoft CNTK, MXNet, TensorFlow, etc. All these frameworks are available as container images in QNAP's container station. 

This repository is to maintain all the QuAI sample applications and respective source codes.
